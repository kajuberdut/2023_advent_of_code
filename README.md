# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my "Advent of Code 2023" repository! This project contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, showcasing various programming techniques within the solutions.

In order to add a bit of reflection to these exercises, I have written a short summary for each problem and my solution. This includes highlighting the techniques I think the problem lends itself to, as well as possible improvements to my approach.
