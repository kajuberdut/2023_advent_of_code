The "Cube Conundrum" is a problem that involves parsing and analyzing data from a series of text-based games. It is ideally suited for techniques like regular expressions (regex) for text parsing, and the use of data structures such as dictionaries for data organization and manipulation. The challenge requires extracting and interpreting numerical data (the quantities of differently colored cubes) from text, a task for which regex is particularly well-suited. Moreover, the problem involves logical reasoning to determine the feasibility of the games based on the given constraints.

The solution begins by defining regex patterns to extract the necessary information from each game's description. The first pattern, GAME_PATTERN, is used to identify the game number, while RGB_PATTERN is designed to capture the quantities of red, green, and blue cubes. The function parse_line utilizes these patterns to parse the game's details, storing the extracted data in a dictionary. For the first part of the problem, the function id_if_possible checks each game against the specified constraints (12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue cubes) to determine if the game is feasible. This is achieved by comparing the maximum number of cubes shown in each round with the available cube count. The second part of the problem requires calculating the "power" of the minimum set of cubes necessary for each game. The function power_of_line computes this by finding the maximum number of cubes of each color shown in a game and then multiplying these values together. The main function, main, orchestrates the solution by loading the input data and applying these functions to solve both parts of the problem.

This exercise serves as an excellent practice in applying regex for text parsing, a common requirement in data processing tasks. It also highlights the importance of choosing appropriate data structures (like dictionaries) for efficiently organizing and accessing data. Additionally, the problem encourages creative thinking in devising logical solutions to determine the feasibility of each game scenario. Overall, it is a valuable exercise in combining regex, data structures, and logical reasoning to solve a complex, multi-faceted problem.
